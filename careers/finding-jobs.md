See [Eric's presentation][2] on behalf of CSS for landing internships. It covers a bit of everything,
from resumes to applying and nailing your interview.

For co-op, job listings are located on the [central co-op portal][3]. For internships, you have to find listings
on your own. Some good places to search:

- [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/). LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters!
  It has an integrated job board with _tons_ of internships.
- [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply), though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of
  fantastic companies that offer internships.
- [Work In Tech](https://www1.communitech.ca/jobs) has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of
  them are not internships.
- [Pitt-CSC](https://github.com/pittcsc) has a giant open source repo that tracks open CS internships for a lot of companies.
    - The organization had a repo for new grad roles, but it is no longer maintained. A current version is maintained by [coderQuad](https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023).

:::warning

Co-op has been known to decline winter internship offers for second-year students because they haven't completed their co-op course training.
If you wish to have a winter internship before you have done your co-op course training, make sure it is one that doesn't go through co-op.
