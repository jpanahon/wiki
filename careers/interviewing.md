### Interview Preparation

Eric recommends studying and practicing technical interview questions for any mid-to-large-sized company. Most of
them will ask you highly technical coding questions.

### Interview Prep Resources

- [LeetCode][4] - Eric highly recommends LeetCode and has used it for all of his interview prep. It has hundreds of
  questions with difficulty ratings and company-specific questions submitted by interviewees. Most internships will
  ask LeetCode easy or medium questions.
- [LeetFree][5] - This website contains all LeetCode Premium problems for free.
- [Cracking the Coding Interview][6] - Eric highly recommends reading this book before getting into LeetCode for
  interview prep. You can find it on [Amazon][7] or as [a PDF online][6].
- [Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions][8] - Online solutions for the problems in Cracking the Coding Interview.
  Harshdip recommends to try all the problems on your own and only looking for solutions once you have tried everything
  you know.
- [HackerRank][9] - Brandon highly recommends getting familiar with the HackerRank editor and available languages.
  Many companies will supply a timed HackerRank coding challenge to be completed when applying to internships. It can
  also be used like LeetCode to solve hundreds of technical programming problems.
- [Glassdoor][10] - Glassdoor allows people to post reviews, salaries and most importantly interview questions they've
  received from specific companies.
- [27 Most Common Interview Questions][11] - An interview is a _test_, and here's the testbank.
