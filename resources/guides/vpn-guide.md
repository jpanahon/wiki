Many protocols or ports are blocked by the university firewall. This is why you may not be able to connect with NoMachine or SSH. If youâ€™re connecting from home and anywhere outside or inside the campus, you have to connect via a VPN server to access resources and data on the campus private network. This is a guide on how to setup the VPN.

## Download

First download the VPN client for your respective machine.

### [Download for Windows and macOS](https://networklogin.uwindsor.ca/)

- Authenticate with your UWinID and password on the university's GlobalProtect Portal to get to the GlobalProtect Client download links. After that, click the link that matches your operating system.

### [Download for Android and Chrome OS](https://networklogin.uwindsor.ca/)

- Follow the steps in the app when prompted. Also [check which Chrome OS Systems support Android Apps](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps) if needed.

### [Download for iOS devices](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/globalprotect/id1400555706)

- Follow the steps in the app when prompted.

### [Download for Linux](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/)

- Install openconnect using the package manager for your Linux distribution.

## After Downloading

After downloading and opening global protect it will ask you for the portal address. **securelogin.uwindsor.ca** is for the CS servers and **networklogin.uwindsor.ca** is for everything else. You will then be asked to sign in with your UWinID (first part of your UWindsor email) and password.
:::warning

To connect with SSH or NoMachine you must use securelogin.uwindsor.ca as the portal address for the VPN, not networklogin.uwindsor.ca
