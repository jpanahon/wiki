This is a guide to the parking spaces around the campus. See this [map](https://maps.mapsted.com/uwindsor) if you would like to see the different UWindsor buildings beforehand.

## Official UWindsor Parking Spaces

There are 17 official parking lots within the UWindsor campus. This includes visitor parking, staff parking, and student parking. You can locate these parking lots in this [campus map](https://web2.uwindsor.ca/pac/campusmap/index.php).

### Student Designated Parking

Student parkings in UWindsor are either pay-and-display, permit-only, or both. Most student parkings are located around Alumni Hall, with a few more parking locations in Leddy, Cartier Hall, Assumption Hall, and the downtown campus.

To obtain a student permit, visit the [UWindsor Parking Online Services](https://parkingonline.uwindsor.ca/). Permits are either 8 months or 12 months (for Fall & Winter), or 2 months or 4 months (for Intersession & Summer).

:::note
While some of these locations (such as the Parking Garage) do not accept cash, some other parking locations (like Leddy special night parking) are coin entry only. For places where student permits and pay-and-display options are both allowed, you do not need to pay if you already have a student permit, but you must display your permit on your vehicle when parking. The hourly rate for parking is $2.00/hr, up to $10.00 maximum per day.

As well, even if you have a student permit (or parking pay stub), you must follow the University's [parking regulations](https://www.uwindsor.ca/parking-services/306/parking-traffic-regulations). The University will fine or, whenever necessary, tow your vehicle if they discover that you have violated the regulations.

### Visitor Parking Space

Visitors are able to use the Parking Garage and the designated visitor parkings around the area.

Unlike students and staff, visitors cannot buy semester/year parking passes. Instead, visitors must pay [a parking rate](https://www.uwindsor.ca/parking-services/299/visitor-parking) by the hour, by the day, by the week, or by the month. However, the University also provides vendor permits in the student parking lots.

### Accessible Parking

The University of Windsor will provide accessible parking to people who requests parking spaces. If you require accessible parking or any other accommodations, make sure to contact the Campus Parking Services and the Office of Human Rights, Equity and Accessibility. They will work with you to make sure that your requests will be fulfilled to the best of their abilities.

If there is a parking meter, it is usually payable by coins.
