This is a guide on how to use and access the important sections on your UWinsite Student page.

## Course Management

### How to Plan & Enroll in Classes

To plan your courses and register in classes in UWinsite Student, you will use the
**Manage Classes** section on the Student Homepage.

#### Planning your Classes

You can start planning your classes and adding them to your Shopping Cart in UWinsite
Student when the validation period opens. The validation period is when the timetable
for the next semester is close to final and the courses being offered are visible in
UWinsite Student. Typically, the validation period starts two to three weeks before
registration begins.

The preferred method for placing your classes into the Shopping Cart is through Class
Search and Enroll. This method shows you just the courses that are offered during the
term for which you are planning.

**To get started planning your classes:**

![UWinsite homepage](../../static/img/uwinsite_guide/uwinsite_homepage.jpg)

1. On the Student Homepage, click the Manage Classes tile.
2. Click the Class Search & Enroll tab in the left navigation menu.
   ![Class search and enroll page](../../static/img/uwinsite_guide/class_search_and_enroll.jpg)
3. Select the term in which you will be registering.
4. In the Search for Classes field, enter a subject area, topic or course code.
5. From the Search Results, select a course.
6. On the **Course Information** page you will see all class sections for the term you
   selected. Some classes have one section while others have multiple sections. Under
   **Class Selection**, you can view the time, date, instructor, location and available seats
   for each section of the class.
   ![Course info and class selection page](../../static/img/uwinsite_guide/course_info_and_class_selection.jpg)
7. Select a class section. You can click anywhere on the class except for the Lecture or
   Lab link to select it.
8. Youâ€™ll now be directed to the confirmation process:
    1. Review **Class Selection** and click **Next**
    2. Review **Class Preferences**
        - This is where you have the option to add yourself to the waitlist if the class is
          full. Select **Yes** if this will not put you in course overload (_normally 5 classes, but
          check your program_).
        - Select **No** if having this course on the waitlist would put you in course overload.
          You will instead need to use **Swap Classes** so UWinsite Student knows what
          course to drop if you are to reach the top of the waitlist.
    3. Click **Accept**
    4. On the **Enroll** or **Add to Cart** page, click the **Add to Shopping Cart** button and
       then click **Next**.
    5. On the **Review and Submit** page, review your selections and then click **Submit**.

#### Registering in your Classes

Registration at UWindsor is by appointment time. Registration appointment times are
assigned based on a number of factors including program and level of study. Your registration appointment time is
assigned based on several factors including program and level of study. Your registration appointment time is
when you can start to register. It is important to register early to have a better chance
of getting into the classes that you want to take. Registration does, however, remain
open until the tenth day of classes so you may make changes to your courses so long
as there is space.

Once registration appointment times are assigned for a term, you can find yours under
**My Academics -> Enrolment Deadlines**. Your registration appointment time will also be
sent to your UWindsor email account.

**When your registration appointment time opens:**

1. On the Student Homepage, click the **Manage Classes** tile.
2. Click the **Shopping Cart** tab in the left navigation menu.
3. Click the radio button next to each of your preferred classes and then click the **Enroll** button.
    - If you are successfully enrolled in a class, you will see a **green check mark** beside it.
    - If you are not enrolled in a class, you will see a **red X** beside it.
4. There are several reasons why you might not be successfully enrolled in a class:
    - The class is full.
    - There is a time conflict
    - Enrolment in the class is restricted for various reasons. For example: it is reserved
      for students in particular majors or levels of study.
    - You may be missing a prerequisite (this should not be the case IF you validated
      your classes).
