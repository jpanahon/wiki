### How to enroll?

1st-4th year students are eligible to enroll but with the instructor's permission [Michelle Bondy](mailto:mbondy@uwindsor.ca). First, you will need a placement such as a lab work, research, or an internship that is related to your program. Do not worry, if you could not find any, there are placements listed for these courses that you could pick from. However, it is better to find your own paid placement. Paid or volunteer placement is valid since the purpose of the courses is to help you gain experience in the professional work environment.

### Requirements:

- Must complete 108 hours during the placement.
- Report bi-weekly hour log and bi-weekly assignment about learning expereience.
- Self evalution for midterm by the student and the final evalution done by the supervisor of the placement.

:::note

**Two Birds with One Stone:**<br/>
You could enrol in this course while you are an [OS program placement](/wiki/academics/outstanding-scholars). Since the OS contract requires you to complete 45-100 hours and the course requires 106 hours and frequent reports to the instructor. With these two requirements satisfied as the OS placement, you use SCIE-3990 or SCIE-3800 as the placement in the OS contract. In the end, you get to complete a placement and a 3 credits course by working for only one.
