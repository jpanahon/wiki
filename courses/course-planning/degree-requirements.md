# Degree Requirements

The University offers four "main" degrees: The standard Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours and General), as well as the Applied Computing specialization, the Software Engineering specialization, and the Computer Information Systems specialization. All options are 40 courses, except for the 30-course General version of the standard degree.

The Applied Computing specialization's main difference is that it removes many of the theoretical computer science requirements, as well as math, and replaces them with more "applied" courses and electives. If you know you aren't interested in those theoretical CS courses (e.x. they are often mandatory when applying for a Master's degree), this may be a good option to choose. Generally speaking, your employment prospects will be the same regardless of option.

You may be interested in the list of [recommended electives](https://github.com/uwindsorcss/wiki/blob/master/courses/course-planning/electives.md), and may also be interested in getting a minor. Note that Honours students receive a Minor in Mathematics for free, just by getting a 60% in each of their required MATH and STAT courses.
