Most CS students take the same courses in their first two years since CS doesn't have many electives. I recommend you to take mandatory courses in these two years as you are going to want to have electives to take fun CS courses in your third and fourth year.
Harshdip has followed this exact sequence.

## Recommended Sequence

#### First Semester

- COMP-1000 Key Concepts in Computer Science
- COMP-1400 Intro to Programming & Algorithms I
- MATH-1720/1760 Functions and Differential Calculus
- MATH-1250/1260 Linear Algebra
- Elective (See if you can take another mandatory course you will have to do in the future)

#### Second Semester

- ECON-1100 Intro to Economics 1 or Psychology (I took econ because I find it more fun and applicable)
- COMP-1410 Intro to Programming & Algorithms II
- COMP-2650 Computer Architecture 1
- MATH-1730 Integral Calculus
- MATH-1020 Mathematical Foundations

#### Third Semester

- COMP-2310 Theoretical Foundations of Comp Sci
- COMP-2120 Obj Oriented Programming using Java
- COMP-2560 Systems Programming
- COMP-2540 Data Structures & Algorithms
- STAT-2910 Statistics for the Sciences

#### Fourth Semester

- COMP-3150 Database Management Systems
- COMP-2140 Languages, Grammars and Translators
- COMP-2660 Computer Architecture 2
- COMP-3220 Object Oriented Software Analysis/Design
- COMP-3710 Artificial Intelligence Concepts

## Planning Your Courses

It is always better to have a good plan about the course you'll be taking each semester. Harshdip has completed 4 semesters, taking all the major courses. This way saving up all the electives is one approach. If you find 5 courses overwhelming, taking only 4 courses or an easy elective as a 5th course is another approach. Check out the list of [electives](/wiki/courses/course-planning/electives).

:::warning

When you are planning for your courses, pay attention to the classes you want to take and the terms of their offering. Many classes, especially third-year or fourth-year classes, are only offered for one particular semester. Thus, make sure that you complete your mandatory classes in time before you make room for other electives.

The recommended sequence works best for Honours Computer Science students, but a lot of the courses above are required for students in other CS programs too. Make sure to look at your [course requirements](https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/282/undergraduate-and-graduate-calendars) to see which courses you need.
